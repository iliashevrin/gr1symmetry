  TITLE:       "Prioritized Arbiter (binary encoded version)"
  DESCRIPTION: "This variant of the prioritized arbiter avoids the linear rise
in the number of inputs with increasing number of clients. To this
end, a client request is encoded in binary using only logarithmically
many bits. This way only one request can be made per time step, which
is answerd by a respective binary encoded grant the same way. As a
consequence, without further restrictions, every request could be
answered immediately. Hence, to complicate the situation again, the
output player is forced to repeate the same grant for one time step
once in a while. This way, it can be possible for the input player to
open multiple requests faster than they can be answered."
